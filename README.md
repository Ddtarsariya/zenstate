# ZenState

A complete, scalable, developer-friendly, and future-proof state management package for Flutter.

## What is ZenState?

ZenState is a state management solution for Flutter that combines the best features of popular state management libraries like Riverpod, GetX, Recoil.js, Redux, MobX, and Cubit, while solving their shortcomings. It provides a clean, intuitive API that is both powerful and easy to use.

Key features:
- 🔄 **Reactive primitives** - Atoms and derived values that automatically update your UI
- 🧩 **Composable** - Build complex state from simple pieces
- 🔌 **No BuildContext dependency** - Access state from anywhere
- 💾 **Persistence support** - Easily save and load state
- ⏱️ **Time travel debugging** - Rewind and replay state changes
- 📊 **Performance monitoring** - Track rebuilds and optimize your app
- 🔌 **Plugin architecture** - Extend functionality with custom plugins
- 🧪 **Testable** - Easy to test and mock
